William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, investor, author,
 philanthropist, and humanitarian. He is best known as the principal founder of Microsoft Corporation.
[2][3] During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software 
architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.

Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Gates launched Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen 
in 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it went on to become the world's largest personal computer
 software company.[4][a] Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO 
in January 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief software architect.[7] In June 2006, 
Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work
 at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation that he and his wife,
 Melinda Gates, established in 2000.[8] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig
 Mundie.[9] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as
 technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.
