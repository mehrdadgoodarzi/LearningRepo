Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin KBE (16 April 1889 â€“ 25 December 1977) was an English comic actor,

 filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film. He became a worldwide icon
 through his screen persona, "The Tramp", and is considered one of the most important figures in
 the history of the film industry. His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the
 Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.

Chaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship, as his father was absent and his mother
 struggled financially, and he was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, 
his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music
 halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the prestigious 
Fred Karno company, which took him to America. He was scouted for the film industry and began 
appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large
 fan base. He directed his own films and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay,
 Mutual, and First National corporations. By 1918, he was one of the best-known figures in the world.
